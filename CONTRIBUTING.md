# Contributing to FirstDay

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FirstDay! At the moment, during this initial development phase, we are not accepting external contributions. This is to ensure that the project evolves according to the planned roadmap and vision.

We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to keep an eye on the repository for future updates, as we may open contributions in the future.

If you have suggestions, feedback, or questions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/abianche/firstday/issues) or contact us directly.

Thank you for your support!
